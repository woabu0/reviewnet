Disgusting customer service,True
worst customer service ever,True
their service is worst.after two hours of order acceptance I called their wari outlet to check about my order.they said they got the order just 22 seconds ago.What a pity!! also said they can't deliver to my location although the app accepted my order on that location.they forcefully cancelled my order.,True
the app ui is really bad and it doesn't accept Bata coupons which was supposed to be used in this app and moreover it delivers to very few locations. overall not a good user experience,True
Useless,True
Their food is great!,True
One of the most third class apps there is in the country! Food is also highly expensive comparing to other delicious pizza services! I'm never ordering a single slice from there ever again 👎,True
Would be nice if you guys let us add more details for our addresses so it's easier and seamless for the delivery guys to find customers,True
Why is this app not working anymore? It's always stuck and says please wait .. I can never enter the app . Please fix this,True

For some reason I have to put my address in every time I order. That's unfathomably annoying. Plus its unstability knows no bounds.,True
Very poor in service product with quality. Without opening outlate they start to apply boosting their apps on different social media to order food. But after install they told that there is only one outlet in savar. Not even in Dhaka. How funny.!!! Just ignor them. Let them open their outlet first. Then install it.,True

The use interface is not to good for our user I think the app can be make a lot better.,True
"The app is just stuck with a blank white screen. Previous comment: They gave lame excuse about why they dont give home delivery option to certain places.. in my case, just the next block! Otherwise the experience was fast and good. Please show past orders and on-going orders and their online payment status. Other than the sms, there is no way to know about the orders. Also allow place to add order notes to say if we want our pizza without chilli or less cheese etc.",True
I often use it to order from pizza hut. Very convenient and pizza hut still has maintained great quality and professional service!,True
