But whenever I place an order I always face issues with their app. Once I faced an issue when I selected an item but because of this buggy app, it did not place during checkout.

Why not deliver in my area Ranabhola... what is the problem.... the roads are fine right now.... can you available delivery in my area now ?!!!,True
we ordered a birthday cake from foodie for my friend. They literally damaged it upon delivery and then made us wait for 2 hours... and during this time all they did was saying sorry... also they made the delivery man call us constantly and the delivery man told us that he will bkash us 200 taka as if we were begging for money....where we already have paid the total 1019 taka in advance. And the irony is it took them 2 freaking hours to decide that they will give us redelivery...,True

"For some days I am not able to place order in this app. Profile screen works, even I can enter the menu of a restaurant but after that either the app freezes or the menu doesn't work at all.",True
There was a bad smell in one of the orders. The food had already started to rot. I complained right away and even sent pictures when they asked. Today they called me and said they spoke with the restaurant...according to the restaurant the food was fine. That’s why they can’t give me a refund. Instead they said they’ll give me a “sorry voucher” for the bad experience. why would any restaurant ever admit that their food was spoiled? What kind of customer service is this?,True
the app is not even working on my phone. I can't see the food menu. I cannot even order it too. please fix it.,True
"They turned off the review section, so what's the use of reviewing? They told me reviews are big so they couldn't fit in the app. What a joke! Tracking order doesn't work at all. The help center is useless and takes 15-20 mins to reply. After 2-3 hours they'll call n say that if u still have food we'll replace it. If any item isn't available, there's no revised bill. Subscription shows pickup order option and discounts but there's hardly any pickup restaurant option or discounts.",True
Poor service😐,True

not very good. because there is no discount and vouchers are available in this app. foodpanda is very good and save our money,True
Foodi is dead. Average waiting time is 50 minutes to 1 hour. Can you imagine? It's like you have to guess when you will be hungry and then order food in 2 days advance. Then MAYBE you will get your food on time.,True
very bad,True
There customer service is not so good. I got my order wrong. I asked solutions. It took them literally 2 hrs to do the right thing.

"This is the worst food delivery app I have used in my life. It once delivered my food at 12:30 in the night after I had placed the order at 9:45ish. And every complaint, I have regarding any issues , it seems they have zero solutions towards it and zero zeal to improve them further. Perhaps the worst food delivery app I have used in the country so far. I generally don't write reviews but they have forced me to. And If there was a way to give a 0 star, they would probably deserve that.",True
The app is good. But the food rescue is a scam. I responded in less than 10 seconds but it shows the offer is not available. They don't give any offers or promo,True
Very bad experience. i Can't find any thing special.,True

The worst app I used ever. Didn't get my food on time. They were late almost 2 hours. I ordered for the first time And get so disappointed. I'll never recommend anyone to use this app ever.

"Worst experience with this app and their customer care executives. They failed to deliver the food within the promised time, and instead of resolving the issue, their response led to further customer harassment. The order was cancelled due to their own fault, yet they unfairly penalized the customer by disabling the Cash on Delivery (COD) option. Extremely disappointing and unacceptable service.",True

"Extremely disappointing. Stay away. They deliver food long after the promised time, & it’s always cold, tasteless, and poorly packed. The customer service is beyond useless—they can’t communicate properly and offer no solution at all. The app and website are a joke—slow, buggy, and missing essential features. Ordering through Foodi feels like a gamble every time. Honestly, Foodpanda is a thousand times better—this company can’t even come close. Foodi is a poorly run, unprofessional, & unreliable",True
I can't even order anything because there is no place to put in a billing address when paying with credit card. My credit card automatically declines every purchase because of this,True

worst help center ever. should get banned for such behaviour,True
"Even as I am writing this review, I am still waiting for my order I placed 2 hours ago. Horrible service. I know they show a bit more discount than the other food apps but trust me, waiting 2 hours is not worth it for any discount. Update: They never delivered the food. cancelled it after 2 hours of waiting. They took no responsibility about it for days when I contacted them. They think that customers are beggars and coupon of 100 taka (not all restaurants) would make everything straight.",True

Terrible delivery time. They say 20-30 minutes for an hour and deliver usually within 50-60 minutes.

"Just another pathetic food delivery service that forces us to use Foodpanda. Very frustrating service, ordered food and kept waiting for 2 hours and when called, they are telling that no delivery man is available. What a joke! Also the app is a toy. The development team does not know UX. Also I'm pretty sure, backend is developed by some freshers and inexpert developers. Please hire a good software company if you have wishes to do business in this field.",True

This is a type of scam. Normal food price in restaurant half of it. Showing fake discounts after increasing the price of food. Takes vat where vat is not necessary.,True
Me and my friends placed order around 9pm and even after an hour there was no update on the food and the food was not even picked up! So we called the rider and he told that he doesn't have enough money for the order to pay the restaurant so he will transfer the order to someone else! And all these happened after an hour and they didn't bothered to call/text. We then called the foodi hotline and they maybe re-routed the order and food was delivered after another 30 mins. So disappointing service,True
Worst selection. I ordered chicken chap they provided quater grill,True
"You guys are no better than Foodpanda or Pathao food like you claim to be. Why is there a 'Minimum order value 100 taka' for every single restaurants? The bachelor's gotta eat guys please understand that. The food prices are going up every single day, the delivery charge is going up 1 taka almost each day, and loads of restaurant unavailable still. Top it off with very laggy and buggy interface and voila! We got a recipe for a perfect disaster that is Foodi.",True
Not good at all..,True

When i order and the app says it'll be delivered in 45 mins i expect it to get delivered in time. If the time passed i want compensation for wasting my time and let me reorder somewhere else.

Very slow delivery service very disappointing 😕,True
What you advertise and what you provide is absolutely different. You clearly advertised 150 tk off above 350tk order for new user. But when I installed and used the promo it gave me 100 tk off.

VERY VERY BAD UX. No matter how good the UI looks, if it cannot meet its main purpose, it has failed.",True

You are imposing 80tk for delivery charge that's fine, you are also increasing the product price (chips, drinks etc) by 10/15 taka, which I can get behind since you are new but WHY WOULD U ADD 15 TAKA VAT ON PRINGLES LIKE WTFFF.
