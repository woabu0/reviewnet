"This is by far the most unprofessional and irresponsible app I have ever used. I placed an order, it was accepted, but the food was never delivered. When I called the delivery boy, he simply dropped the call. I tried reaching the helpline, but no one ever picked up. To make things worse, the app did not cancel my order, did not notify me, and left me completely in the dark. The entire day passed without any response. This is not a one-time issue—it has happened to me multiple times.",True
Who the hell give more than 1 star to this garbage app? Nothing is found in this app. Totally absurd.,True
West of time. Everything Unavailable😆😆,True
"This app has become horrible over time. It went on a hiatus for a couple of months, and then came back, with even more bugs. Today I ordered food, and for 50 minutes, not a single rider took my order!!! I called the support and the call doesn't even go to that number!! Is this a joke?? Even not a single news if there is any maintenance going on or something. It has become totally rubbish.",True
