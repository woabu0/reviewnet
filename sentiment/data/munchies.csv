worst customer service... theres a few good restaurent .. they charge more than 100 taka for delivery still .. they take 2 hours for 40-50 mins delivery then when you recieve the food .. its not something you can eat ..

very bad experience,True
Service is horrible. Delivery is always late by more than an hour. Last delivery took 3 hours. The riders also always spill drinks & do not say anything until caught. Food always arrives cold.

All the non Foodpanda apps are equally unprofessional and incompetant.,True

"It's a really great app, specially for late night foodies, it actually help us to relive from late night food cravings",True
They'r should be more options for payment. One can only pay by Bkash no other option available. What's if one doesn't have bkash but have Debit Card or Nagad how does he/she order? U should have multiple payment options like other food delivery app's. U may consider adding alternative & more payment option's.,True
LAG,True
"App lags when trying to log in/ Place order , But it works. Need filter based on distance. And BTW where to get promos? Is there any?",True

Worst app if you are using it in late night full of Garbage no one even response,True
"Rubbish service. Not one delivery is made before 2hours. Have to contact support everytime for faster delivery. Foods are usually cold to the touch due to late deliveries. Not to forget 5% additional charge over the delivery charge as well. Complete and utter disappointment. And lastly, for a midnight food delivery service their delivery man never ever has change. Always have to pay an extra 20-60tk because there is no way to get change at that hour.",True
"Customer service is terrible. I once called their hotline to inquire about a delivery that was running late and they proceeded to lie to me by saying that the delivery person is waiting outside the restaurant to collect my food. They didn't stop to think that I would definitely call the restaurant, who confirmed that there was no delivery person waiting outside their restaurant. After that, the hotline went totally cold as they stopped answering my calls. They didn't even resolve my complaint.",True

"This is the 3rd and last time I used this app. The first time, I received my food after 2.5 hours. Though it was a one-time mistake so order a 2nd time. Got the food in an hour. Tonight, even though the app showed 29-34 mins, it has been 1.5 hours. No food.",True

"HORRIBLE! Got SCAMMED by restaurants on their platform, nothing was done even after complaining and explaining. Took my money through lies.",True
The app doesn't work properly. It doesn't even have updates.,True
"Poorly developed. The ""Confirm Address"" button does not work if I have not set the location from the map. There is a field for inputting the address, but it is not functioning as an input field. Instead, it is acting as a field for viewing the address on the map. Unfortunately, setting the location from the map does not provide the correct address, and I cannot even set it to the correct one. I have just wasted my time.",True
Service was super but app is so bad. Can't enter.,True
Not open.. Just loading..,True
"I tried to order several times from this app but failed. Everytime it says that the restaurant I chose does not deliver to my area. However, every restaurant I have picked says that they deliver all over Dhaka using Munchies. I even called the restaurants directly and asked them. They said I should call the Munchies Helpline and order directly there if the app isn't working. But no one picks up the call at the helpline. What's the point of a delivery app if I can't even order?!",True
takes too much time. and expensive also,True
"The UI ain't so bad but the ""experience"" is terrible. There a lot of problea with the app which can found by just browsing a little. You need work more, really more on the app. Though gotta say, it's fast at least faster than the website. Smoother, faster payment, works quite nicely for emm... just order and leave?! Yeah. Welp that's all most people need sooo... Good. But please work on the app.",True
"Worst delivery app, shows 30 min delivers after 1 hour. Service so bad that they couldn't even provide me my order correctly. I wish i could give 0 star",True

top-notch application specifically for the 24/7 service... 👌,True
"Weird, weak ordered for the second time, they be like refused to do. Not promising",True
A blessing for the cravings,True
Slow service,True
"If a restaurant is not delivering in my area, WHY SHOW IT?? BOGUS APP.",True
"For mid night delivery, it’s perfect. But after submit the order, no one can contact to munchies or delivery man unless they contact us. It's the worse idea I've ever seen. Even if we call the munchies number which is listed, no one ever picked up my call.",True
nice,True
"keeping in mind that the app and service launched a few weeks ago, the service itself is decent. but the delivery time from making ur food to delivering it is a bit time consuming than ur average food delivery services but is good enough. the app lacks in a few fundamental things. u cant see any information about ur deliverer, their contact no, where they are. absolutely nothing except an estimation of ur delivery time. i hope to see those fundamental things added in the near future.",True
More area need to cover I can't order because restaurants dont allow order from Aftabnagar,True
"After putting referral code several time , it show invalid",True
I've ordered couple of time and I got delivery with in 35 min. Also love their 18+ ptoducts. Best of luck munchies.,True

Good quality food product delivery service by home.,True
It's very good service for food lover,True
Great delivery service.,True
Ok,True

This app is only for Bangladesh and it is fake waste of time and data,True
Delivery system and customer service is awful. They should change their behaviour towards customer. Took more than 2 hours to deliver while showing 54 minutes.,True
Very poor delivery service..,True
"Everything Seems good but delivery time too long, food gets cold & User Registration takes time ..",True
"Apps doesn't work, crashes all the time. Connection error and their food service is not good at all. In my first order it tool almost 1 and half hour but it was given 67 minutes max. The food was also wrong,Resturant send me a botol of water instead of cold drinks.",True
No use of complaining. In Bangladesh business goes on. Thank you for giving us a terrible experience.,True
Their service was quite good. I'd recommend it.,True
Food delivery is too expensive and takes too long,True
"They need to work on their app real bad. I see discounts like 'any pizza on Fat Boy Pies for 600 taka' but I cannot see any option to choose that in their app. And whenever there is a discount the original price gets slashed and sicounted price is shown but whenever I add that specific item, the original price gets added not the discounted price. VERY VERY BAD UX. No matter how good the UI looks, if it cannot meet its main purpose, it has failed.",True
Good quality food,True
Although the interface is pretty cool the app itself is glitchy. The customer service is terrible. Orders are never delivered on time. Expect atleast over two and half hours of waiting period after placing your order which doesn't add up since they operate when streets of Dhaka are mostly empty.,True
good,True
"I get that you guys are new but the charges that you are imposing are ridiculous. You are imposing 80tk for delivery charge that's fine, you are also increasing the product price (chips, drinks etc) by 10/15 taka, which I can get behind since you are new but WHY WOULD U ADD 15 TAKA VAT ON PRINGLES LIKE WTFFF. WHAT IS THIS VAT FOR AND HOW ARE YOU STILL IN BUSINESS. Somebody sue them. Not going to recommend you.",True
App does not show the right time remaining and also I got the wrong items delivered for double the price. What a horrible first experience. Not trying them out again.,True
"hi everyone, This is not first time they didn't provide a plastic spoon or fork . Like seriously this is a excuse you tell to your customers. Every customer always thinks that the restaurant will provide a napkin or fork but unfortunately you can't even provide that. I remember i complained to munchies about how the pizza was delivered. COMPLETELY UPSIDE-DOWN but sorry to say still no initiative was taken. How much ever i complain they never take it seriously",True
Nice,True
nice,True
Food was delicious..,True
Third class food. They've sent me cold food it wasn't fresh. So much disappointed.,True
Great,True
There are no options in my city so I don't particularly like this application.,True
Amazing app for late night food delivery,True
Nice,True
bad,True
"Fantastic. I use to be awake at late night for work and study. Whenever I feel hungry, just order from Munchies. That's it. Problem solved. Such a relief for the people like me. Godspeed.",True
Just mind blowing,True
Took 2 and half hours and the dumplings were not soft enough. Wouldn't recommend.,True
Amazing!,True
They are giving false delivery time in their apps. They dont delivery food on time and try to avoid customer by giving different reason.,True
Options to order from multiple restaurants at the same time would be nice,True
So many bugs ... cant order food from multiple restaurant at once after update with SAME delivery cost. I used to get order in my area before now with this app i cant even order in my location. Soft drinks item doesnt include any diet cola/ pepsi too. I would prefer old system,True
Good,True
Delivery man needs to be well trained,True
Best late night service in BD,True
"**postive** If you live in Dhaka. Want to have some essential items or food at night. Munchies got you covered. I'd like to suggest you to give a try. App is smooth and UI is so attractive. Overall, It was a very good experience.",True
