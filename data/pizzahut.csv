খুবই বাজে একটা App ট্রাকিং করা যায় না। এই app এর কোন দরকার ছিল না ফুডপান্ডা দিয়ে ডেলিভারি করে বাজে অভিজ্ঞতা এটাই শেষ অর্ডার।
"Khet, faltu, fokinni, 3rd class, Dominos Better."
Good 👍
I didn't order yet but the pizzas are very good
very disappointing app
I'm unable to go through the otp verification. It seems the app is taking unnecessary time and then saying the validity time expired.
Disgusting customer service
worst customer service ever
their service is worst.after two hours of order acceptance I called their wari outlet to check about my order.they said they got the order just 22 seconds ago.What a pity!! also said they can't deliver to my location although the app accepted my order on that location.they forcefully cancelled my order.
the app ui is really bad and it doesn't accept Bata coupons which was supposed to be used in this app and moreover it delivers to very few locations. overall not a good user experience
Useless
Their food is great!
One of the most third class apps there is in the country! Food is also highly expensive comparing to other delicious pizza services! I'm never ordering a single slice from there ever again 👎
Very poorly maintained app..needs much improvement.
Would be nice if you guys let us add more details for our addresses so it's easier and seamless for the delivery guys to find customers
Why is this app not working anymore? It's always stuck and says please wait .. I can never enter the app . Please fix this
The Pizza is good
Very nice app
They serve the worst food. Total waste of money. They were showing the food was delivered almost 30mins before delivering the food.
Very bad experience 😕
Good app 👌👌👌👌👌
Worst app ever. They don't even deliver in my place. Wonder if they even deliver food. This app should not exist if someone has to go to the store to eat their pizza.
Good food
🤟👍
Awesome
Very bad dominoes is better option
Too slow but taste is good
Pizza Hut goods Bangladesh
This app is most useful for your Daily routine.
Very Good
Needs some genuine improvement.

they don't send OTP.
"Pizza hut, Basabo is the very good one ."
Puzza Hut 🍕 Basabo best
They dont send otp..i tried with 3 different mobile numbers...stupid app
Fake marketing policy they fool people
App is full of bugs cannot use it properly. The app stops working time to time.
Bad experience. Need to improve a lot.
It's wonderful
Very poor pizza. Took too much time to deliver and got cold pizza. Dominos is far better than this. Waste of money and time.
Ok
Paaz hat
Poor service. Not satisfied
They deliver at very limited places...
Cool
you should deliver in nakhalpara
No invoice sent in the email or shown in the app after making a order. Please try to follow your competitor's (Domino's) app atleast !!
So poor. They have no live tracking and i don't know when my order will be delivered by this app.
Third class User experience in this app
Yammy
One Of the best Pizza selling app.........🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍
Very poor service. Ordered from the app and waited half an hour but no update. When I call ed the store they said their riders are o. Holiday and omno one is checking the online orders. Not recommend at all!!!
For some reason I have to put my address in every time I order. That's unfathomably annoying. Plus its unstability knows no bounds.
Very poor in service product with quality. Without opening outlate they start to apply boosting their apps on different social media to order food. But after install they told that there is only one outlet in savar. Not even in Dhaka. How funny.!!! Just ignor them. Let them open their outlet first. Then install it.
Apps is not connection
Great Online Order App..Great Service but needs to Upgrade on Acount..like having Fav. Pizza & Points & Discounts & Coupons..Stuff like that..
I'm never able to order from this app. Doesn't redirect me to the payment gateway.
Price is too much comparison to quality and quantity.
Good app
"Price is not updated.every time i order pizza from shawrapara branch by using this app or pizza hut bd website,they charge me extra & told me that price is not updated in app/ website,you have to pay more.disaster app & website."
Good
Worst experience Worst services
"It is showing wrong address, and is not allowing to correct it."
Good app 4 pizza lovers
Too much price
The use interface is not to good for our user I think the app can be make a lot better.
"The app is just stuck with a blank white screen. Previous comment: They gave lame excuse about why they dont give home delivery option to certain places.. in my case, just the next block! Otherwise the experience was fast and good. Please show past orders and on-going orders and their online payment status. Other than the sms, there is no way to know about the orders. Also allow place to add order notes to say if we want our pizza without chilli or less cheese etc."
I often use it to order from pizza hut. Very convenient and pizza hut still has maintained great quality and professional service!

unable to detect my location
Unable to Find location 👎
বাটপারি ছাড়া কিছুনা। একটা কিনলে একটা ফ্রি বলে ১৮০০ টাকা দাম ধরে একটা ফ্রি😂😂
লকেশন সেট হয় না
"Akta madarcod marka app, amader areae naiga"
Unstable app. Lagging issues. Can't detect location.
Doesn't work
Good app otp
Please include tracking option after order
"Does not work, app unable to find my location, just loading and loading.. its a dumb app.. r u trying to lose business with this app ??"
IT'S NOT GIVING ME ANY OTP
Most worst and stupid app if i order through app it never executive why I have a pending order no 127437 and payment already done
When I scroll up and down virtual menu the page moves slow. Must be the low framerate. Plus the overall interface or design could have been better.
Nice but price slightly high
I love pizzahut

"Very poor app.Whenever I open the app, it always just buffers.Very poor quality."
High delivery charge
More than a week Pizza Hut🍇 Bangladesh app cannot be open🍇 in my mobile. Please my question to Pizza Hut🍇 Bangldesh app authority.......Why???🤔🤕🤔🤕
Short Area Coverage.
Worst App
"It says it won't deliver to Eskaton Garden from the New Bailey Road branch ... what a pity ! I only installed the app to check how it is and I ended up finding out the fact, that they don't deliver, even to the areas closest to them. Had no choice but to uninstall this app."
Please optimize for z fold 3
🔥Email address is not working 🔥🤬🤬🤬😡
Josss forever
Good easy app.

It does not work at all. I could never order.

This is the worst app ever.I still haven't got my order.
Like it
this app is verry dangares one your phone.. this app install your phone then click open one one now crash or damage your phone and leak your privacy.. to be install to your Risk..
This app works only on the first time. Then you have to clear the cache+data to make it work again.
App doesn't open 2nd time after installation
Didn’t pay via online payment
ভালো সার্ভিস প্রদান করে এখানকার ডেলিভারি ম্যান।
"Everytime I open the app, they tell me to update. New version available. Even after uninstalling and then installing the latest version, they still tell me to update. Please solve this issue."
"The best Pizza shop have worst apps. Network error/network down/otp expired/blank screen and overall dead apps. Also of it works, not possoble to have delivered within Chittagong. Not sure for other area. Worst developed apps."
Product quality is very good and delivery also fast.
Payment option not working. Tried many times but no use. Called the nearest Pizza Hut location they just gave lame excuses about network being down. Need major improvement with this app and service.
App gets stopped when i try to pay
Good
Excellent
Good apps
Excellent.
It's good.
VERY GOOD APP AND VERY YUMMY PIZZA
Nice

In New Eskaton Road you should start delivery on prepaid system.
Very bad.. Need to improve..

Very bad app
Love it
I want to delete the app because it says they don’t deliver in my area through the app. but i haven’t found the delete option. kindly help me in this regard.
Pizza is good but not the app
"This app has fatal bugs. I ordered online via this app and also paid online. Unfortunately i havenot received any pizza even almost 2 days gone! Fortunately i took screenshot of my order. You will not be able to see your ongoing order or order status in this app. After making contact with their outlet, they helped me. So, Be careful. Don't pay online via this app. Always order cash on delivery."
Nice
V good
Fake representations of offers is not a good way of marketing.
Nice
Very good apps
I have ordered pizza at about 2 pm and now its 6pm..still i didnot get my pizza.even I am not being able to reach them... They have taken money yet no estimated delivery time and contact. Poor show.

It says it doesn't deliver to my area though my area is just about 10 minutes away from its nearest sales point.
Nice
"Love this app, love Pizza Hut.... On this app I don't find my order details (order no, tracking details), please update those.."
