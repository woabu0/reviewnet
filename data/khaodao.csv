খুব বাজে একটা অ্যাপ।
"Worst experience, this app interface isn't user friendly."
it's not good
complete scam 😡
"why tf this app doing in play store, low accuracy of gps. Rated 2* but then I realized I've given too much ratings. Now its okay."
"On a 'cash on delivery', a guy from their office called on WhatsApp, pretending to be a rider, asked for an advance in his personal Bkash account, and then started talking garbage."
Joghonno service.
"I tried otp for 10 times ,every time fails"
"Shakil Ahmad ""OBHAI"" kno left korla? Aitai o ki same kaj korba? Pathao, foodie, food panda, etc der satha compete korte hola ai business plan cholbo na...."
"App quality is poor. Please don't waste your time on this app. You can try another app like... foodi, foodpanda etc."
terrible app. Not a single restaurant is open inside the app. meanwhile other food delivery apps said they are open.
fraud

"it asked for otp to login, I added my number but I never receive any otp. I tried two times and then it keeps showing something went error!"
Very bad
No service
The rider asked me for money in advance in his personal bkash account. what type of delivery app is this. either don take cash on delivery orders or stop this nonsense. Complete garbage of an app
inactive app
"no customer care service.Delay delivery, i payment advance but cannot get same amount food.Very horrible."
This app is a total scam. They will consume 50-80 minutes to deliver a food. Service is really poor. They have a fixed delivery man for a region. The delivery man collects food from a lot of restaurants and deliver to multiple customers and so the food is super delayed. Their management also does not take any action on any complaints. They are so unprofessional.
can't even log in this trash app
Order delivers at late. I had to wait almost 1 hour more than the time it had mentioned.
Takes too much time to deliver the food
login e kora jay na eikhane code Ashe na Ami onk din try korchi faltu app
"not recommended, very poor service."
so bad 👎
"একটা খাবার অর্ডার করলাম, প্রায় ১ ঘন্টা হয়ে যায় এখনো খাবার হাতে পাই নাই, এতো লেট ডেলিভারি হলে কাস্টমার স্যাটিসফাই করতে পারবেন না।"
Even after trying for several times I still haven't get any OTP so that I can log in
your cart sometimes says empty I miss out on a lot of offers because of it please fix it asap.
The worst food app ever.
worst app ever. Riders are worst. do not deliver food on time. Just worst. I do not recommend anyone to order food from here.
Otp e ahse na.
"Waiting for the OTP for a long time but no OTP has come so far, Very Very much Bad App. Close this App"
Very poor and dissapponting app.After showing preparing your food for 50 minutes it says order cancelled.
"Used to be good. Now they cancel orders without notifying, even from restaurants that are within walking distance"
"The best delivery app I’ve used. Quick, easy, and affordable."
Very reliable delivery service and friendly customer support.
"Fast delivery, good customer service, and great discounts."
OTP problem
User-friendly app and great discounts. Highly recommend to everyone.
Great discounts and fast service. Khaodao is my favorite delivery app.
Love the user-friendly interface and the quick delivery times.
Best deals and reliable service. My go-to app for food delivery.
App works perfectly and the delivery is always prompt. Very pleased.
Super convenient with lots of restaurant options. Five stars!
Every order has been on time and the app is simple to use. Very satisfied.
"Amazing service, food always arrives hot and fresh. Will keep using regularly."
"Best food delivery experience so far. Fast, reliable, and very convenient."
"Quick delivery, great variety of options, and very user-friendly. Highly recommended."
Excellent app! Fast delivery and customer service always ready to help. Very satisfied!
Purai faltu..
"They’re riders are always friendly and respectful, which makes the experience even better."
Adds hidden charge at the end
it takes literally 2 hours to deliver any kind of food and there is no option to check rider's location
Too much delivery charges
"Delivery map nai, accept kore prepare korte somoy gap eta kemon. Rider active na, taderke phn kore status jante hoy, chat option thakleo useless. Overall need improvement"
I’ve discovered so many new cuisines through this app
I can always count on khaodao for getting food when I need it!
"Worst service. They delivered after 2 hrs of plaicing the order. Also, they updated the status to delivered without delivering it. Seems to be very fishy and fraudulent."
"I’m a dessert lover, and this app has some fantastic dessert options."
Worst-ever
Worst food app and discount policy in Bangladesh.. Trying 10 times for OTP...No Reply... Discount policy is a scam.. Other new apps are doing far better job in this sector..Don't download this app..
After 10 orders I'm reviewing. Tooo slow..
This app is so bad I ordered something and I paid early with my card but nvr received my food I clearly paid but they told me I haven't paid yet it took my money and nvr gave me my food if I could I would rated it in minus
Very much Delay. I ordered multiple times & each time they completed the delivery after e long time. Their riders do not pay attention to anything. They do not take any suggestions. Rubbish service.
Confusing UI. Not user friendly.
"Disgusting app.They advertising it in Facebook,but can't take order from Dhaka University.Even foodi & Foodpanda deliver here."
"Worst Delivery service ever..I ordered, Also did advanced payment then waited for 1 .5 hour....it showed my order is prepared and after 1 hour they cancelled it... Don't order using this scam app..Poor service"
"Rate is higher then restaurants, even higher then other Food delivery service app."
"One of the worst services i have experienced. They show bill before order, but the bill changes after confirming the order. Also don't have the option to cancel the order."
This is very good app
"Very cute logo,, interface is quite easy to handle,, but it's a long way to development,, have great hope for the future"
Good app
The reordering feature is good! I can quickly get my favorite meals without having to search for them every time.
Gd apps
Very bad service. Delivered food too much late.

Don’t waste time installing this. It's 10 am and all the restaurants are closed.
Awesome Service

"Easy to use and lots of restaurant options. Sometimes deliveries are late, but overall good.👍"
Etc.
"Sometimes there are issues with missing items, but usually resolved quickly. Keep it up!!👍"
Didn't like the new update
They informed me that the food is not available after 1 hour of ordering the food!
Khaodao khubi valo ekta food delivery service company.
"One of the most bad app I ever install in my phone this app didn't support COD,bikash or card when other app provide all of this feature"
"Never order from this app. They are fraudulent and unprofessional. They cancel orders without delivering them, claiming the customer is unreachable after just giving a missed call👎👎"
Cannot give service at my area.lol
Most of the riders are well mannered
Ordered pizza 2 days in a row. Delivery on time. Totally satisfied. Packaging should be upgraded.
User-friendly interface. Customer service could be better.
Service was very worst. Cancelled order without any notice

Why is it not available in Chittagong?
Literally bad. I've ordered a meal and 15 minutes gone- no update or something on the order if it's accepted or not. They don't have any cancel option either. I had to manually call the call center and cancel the order. Bad service.
Worst service ever.Dont order anything from here.
Worst experience ever.
Delivery charge onk rakhe Khabar er thika delivery charge besi

"I'm receiving No otp, this app is a joke"
Baler app...
"As soon as you enter this app, it asks for location access. Even after giving that access, you have to manually select the location while confirming the order. Though we have to manually select the location, why does it want location access at the beginning? It's a very suspicious matter."
Waiting for almost 1 and half hours for the food. Absolutely ridiculous!!!!
This is so much irritating when a notification comes and it's vibrate! Please remove this vibrate option or give a setting option where user can manually choose that they want this vibrate option or not!!
Worst App. They don't know how to do business. Don't waste your time installing this app.
"Delivered food was half eaten, when called the help center they defended thier rider"
"Delivery people are the most lazinest, few restaurants, no options to complain about bad food."
Totally fake app. No restaurant are available here. Don't download and waste your 2 mins.
fraud.
it doesn't even show any food... it's a scam app. don't install it
Bro this app is a scam!!!
Expand your area to hazaribagh...

Super Trash App!. Do not download it. It sucks.
"First of all Their promo code are too much nonsense ..Too much delivery charge, Which is very disappointed Also take too much time to delivered good"
"Wow,Very G❤️❤️D App"
"Regrettably, we do not have any restaurant in Bhola. Please solve this"
Worst app don't install it ngt works ND the delivery charges r half the price of the foods dlt this app
Totally disgusting
Blank page load kore ekhono. Offer diye lav ki jodi app ekhono incompleted thake!?
Best app for nothing in the world
WORST SERVICE EVER. SCAM OFFERS.
I gave the order...the distance from the resturant is around a 15 min walk...But the order took me around 1 hour to get. 20 mins after ordering my rider contacts me and asks me if my order confirm? Then after around 40 mins I get my order. All these and a 50 tk service charge Not recommended Foodpanda is better
Horrible experience
Delivery time is too much delayed. Please improve this.
wrost
So bad
Absolutely rubbish. Very unprofessional delivery man & customer service. Also lot of issues with app. Will never use this again.
"very poor servese, not available for all area"
code send failed
Why my address is unavailable? It is 22 no ward in Dhaka
add a feature to pre order food before restaurant opening
🤣🤣🤣🤣 bro street food also having online apps now... Create restaurant all over the country first. Then think about this app. You don't have any service in maximum places in the country. Who do you think will download the app?? Stupid.
"Horrible service, i got my delivery after 2 hours. Fake promotions as well 😑😑😑"
"Food delivery was late more then 1.5 hours!! In the app, the rider is showing the food is already delivered. N customer care doesn't pick the calls!!"
Ami akta kachchi order korte chailam bt amr location naki avilable na dekhai....i think its scams
worst app ever.
"Never come to any use, totally a useless scattered app."
They are not what the say. I installed the app and looked for offers. But they don’t have it. Just hoax.
Third class app and service
"I placed my order before lunch, but no rider picked it up. About two hours later, a rider was assigned. I called him around 10 times, but he didn't answer. In the evening, around four hours later, the rider canceled, citing ""Customer wants to cancel"" as the reason. Meanwhile, I tried to contact customer care, but they showed no remorse, stating that the delay was expected due to rush hour."
খুবই বাজে। বিজ্ঞাপনের সঙ্গে অফারের কোনো মিল নেই । খুবই বাজে। ইনস্টল করেও অনইনস্টল করতে বাধ্য হলাম।
Distance is less than a kilometre but they can't deliver 🤣🤣
0000000 Kuttae baccha.
Don't install this app because they will deceive you.
This app asks advance for cash on food delivery
Fake marketing... Totally useless. Only GUI is good.
"Uninstalled because this app shows it's unavailable in my area (Basila, Mohammadpur). Please widen your service range. foodpanda have been doing delivery here just fine."
Worst food delivery app I ever used. Delivery man called me 2.5 hours later to deliver my parcel.

They first accept the order and then show the excuse of lack of logistics and canceled my order. Very disappointing
"Need to add more restaurants, and should expand the coverage area."
buggy app. unusable.

They need to improve their food delivery service. Every time they took way too longer time to deliver my food than the esmited time which is written on the app
Bal er apps
"Disgraceful...this company tells everyone there is a discount but they try to hide the promo code.Come on,if you can't give discounts then stop these cheap marketing.Now look this app has a good UI but terrible marketing."
"First time ordered cash on delivery. The food was great, service was satisfying and food arrived within 45minutes. Second time ordered via online payment. Delivery time went like 2 hours (since there was rush), but the food was great. No complain. Looking forward for more restaurants to be available 😀 best wishes"
worst food platform ever. it took 2 hours for my foods to arrive. when i used the code delivery charge increases a lot. scam
Empty app
Third class service.. waste of time. Falty
"Food quality is below standards, took a whole hour and delivered cold food, no bacon in a burger which is literally named ""Bacon Bites"" 😭 Instructions were completely ignored"
Its a most bad app i ever seen🤮
"Slow delivery, makes the food cold enough to not eidable"
If I had the chance I would have given this 0 ratings.... It's the worst food delivering app in the world 🤮🤮
"I have never seen a more fake app than this. They will show like they are giving a lot of offers. But in actual , they don't give any offers. When you apply promo code , the delivery charge will automatically increase 😂 Jottohshob faltu app 😂"
They are too much slow. If a restaurant can't serve the food in 35 mints then don't mention it! You guys take 30 mints more than the mention time.
"Very very very much excellent service,,,they refund back if u order mistakenly"
Worst App. Please solve all bugs then launch your bokachoda app.

It's fake app. Don’t use it. A scam to hijack money. Be careful. Contact no is also fake.
"App full of bugs, can't even see a restaurant"
"Absolutely horrible application. The cart doesn't load regardless of what I order. It cannot pinpoint my location correctly either. I eventually deleted the cache and data, so I can start from the beginning again. Upon restarting the application, it failed to verify my number - thus locking me out of the app. Here's an advice, if you've disconnected the backend server, kindly notify the customers. Save our time! Undoubtedly the worst delivery service application I've stumbled upon."
Couldn’t even sign up.
Full of Bugs... 🤬
"Very bad, when you can't deliver, then why you show those restaurants?? Very disappointed service"

Worst food delivery app ever. Delivery latency than foodpanda or others about 1 hour or more. Delivery fee is higher than the others. Fully Scammed!

Just another food delivery service trying to make a quick buck.
"তাদের সার্ভিস এবং অফার গুলো খুব ভালো কিন্তু যেসব রেস্টুরেন্ট গুলা অফার দেয় তাদের খাবার নিম্ন মানের, এই নিম্ন মানের খাবার গুলোর জন্য ভোগান্তির শিকার হয় গ্রাহকেরা কারন তাদের এই খানে অভিযোগ দেওয়ার কোনো অপশন রাখেন নাই। অভিযোগ যদি দিতে হয় তাহলে তাদের ফেসবুক পেইজ থেকে ম্যাসেজ দিয়ে করতে হয়। আর তাদেরকে ম্যাসেজ দিয়েও কোনো সমাধান হয় না। তাদের এই অনাকাঙ্ক্ষিত ভুলের কারনে রেস্টুরেন্ট মালিকরা নষ্ট খাবার ডেলিভারি করে গ্রাহকদের কাছে। বি:দ্র: খাবারের মান রাস্তায় দাঁড়িয়ে থেকে চেক করা সব সময় সম্ভব হয় না।"
একদম আনপ্রফেশনাল।অফারে ফুড ডেলিভারি না করতে পারলে অফার দেবার কি দরকার?পর পর দুই দিন অর্ডার কনফার্ম করার পর রাইডার ফোন দিয়ে বলে সরি খাবার ডেলিভারি হবে না।আজকে প্রায় অর্ডার কনফার্ম হবার ১.৩০ ঘন্টা পর খাবার রিসিভ করার সময় এর আগ মূহুর্তে রাইডার ফোন দিয়ে বলে সরি স্যার আজকে হবে না আপনি চাইলে আগামীকাল অর্ডার দিতে পারেন।প্রথম দুইবার অর্ডারে একই কাহিনী।একদম বাজে সার্ভিস।আমার মনে হয়না এই এপ আর ব্যাবহার করা হবে আর ভবিষ্যতে।
They are showing that kacchi Bhai giving 50% discount but on this app there’s no kacchi vai
The app is beautiful but there is a bug in the moment which is when I get the OTP I can not write the OTP because there is no keyboard coming out
"Worst app ever,dont download"
"Could use a live tracking system,as to where the rider is located"
Very disappointing Already send 30+times OTP request towards phone But don't get OTP for sign up.
They are quite good with the service. But they are providing food delivery service in certain area that might be upsetting for some. Other than that all is good you shoud definitely give it a try.
খুবই বাজে সার্ভিস। অফারের নামে গ্রাহককে ঠকানো হচ্ছে। দাম কয়েকগুণ বেশি দেখিয়ে খারাপ মানের খাবার দিয়ে মুনাফা করছে।
Very bad. no have any deal any restaurant
"ফাউল এপ।ইন্টারফেস ভালো না,ইউ আই এক্সপিরিয়েন্স খারাপ,সব মিলায়া বাজে অভিজ্ঞতা।"
Doesn't deliver in my area even though customer care say they did 🙃
Recently I have used the app and I was amazed how they are offering services. Definitely one of the best food delivery app in Bangladesh. I would recommend to give it a try.
Better than any other food delivery app. Very very user friendly and easy to navigate.
Very worst...
"Worst food delivery app ever! Even foodi thekeo baje, 2 hours lagaise ekta delivery dite, Foodpanda jekhane 30-45 minutes e dey delivery. Second time ar order korbo na."

Food delivery person doesn't even know to use Google maps. Just a single burger took 1Hour 30mins to deliver.......
Disgusting app 😠😠😠
Worst appp ever
true example of a worst app... Their vouchers doesn't work in any restaurants.Literally one of the worst food delivery app I ever used.
"Fake app, the pablum is not in the restaurant list. But in Facebook the shared an offer from the pablum."
Worst food delivery app in BD
"Actually I think they cheat indirectly to customer.2 days ago,my friend ordered some food by it.they delivered food with high discount.discount encourages people to make order and save money.but due to discount,they intentionally downgrade food quality.Likewise,in pabulum BBQ Burger,i got a little amount patty which can be compared to a burger with no patty.sauce was given too much with slight amount of cheese.where food panda did struggle to give discount in crisis,how khaodao could give it??"
Had to wait like 40 mins with hungry stomach and then they cancelled order!
Best Service
ওয়াও
"Very bad service, food delivered after 2 hours and cold food, I have never seen such bad service in my life...😥"
"You should change the title into ""Mirpur Food app"" 😡 waste of time"

খুব বাজে সার্ভিস। অর্ডার করার ২ ঘন্টা পরে খাবার নিয়ে এসেছে। আমি রেস্টুরেন্টে খোজ নিয়ে দেখেছিলাম তারা অর্ডার করার ৩০ মিনিটের মধ্যেই খাবারটি রেডি করে রেখেছিল কিন্তু রাইডারের কোন খোজ নেই। রেস্টুরেন্ট থেকে আমার বাসার দূরত্ব ১.৫ কিলোমিটার এর বেশি না। এতটুকু ডিস্টেন্স এ কি ২ ঘন্টা লাগে?

Wrost food delivery app
Tried All day long but the same message telling Delivery service is unavailable because of capacity issue.
Very very limited choice of restaurants
Ordered two pizza but got one and also would recommend to do a contactless order system need to improve a lot and not really recommend
Should hire more professional delivery man who has the minimum idea where the place is. One star is just for the delivery process. Please develope it.
Bekar Apps! Not user friendly at all.
Worst app ever.... No discounts are Valid.... Disgusting....

I have not seen any worse food delivery than this. Terrible user interface and experience
Worst app

They need to work on it a lot to be able to survive in the market. It's not that great compared to its competitors.
