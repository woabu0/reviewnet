i have been trying to open my account for so long but they keep saying i have to have my password '8-15' words but i am doing exactly that. its still not opening. so bad i am very disappointed,True
very bad app. there is 25% flat discount in a restaurant. but while ordering it is not applying it. there is no option of see the ratings and the reviews of others. 👎👎👎,True
I had 5 stars review given here till they refused to compensate for a wrong delivery with an excuse saying I got food that had 90 taka more price than the food I ordered and didn't care about the wrong delivery. Like I ordered food that I want to eat not something to resell so money is not everything here.,True
Not update location. Very bad app,True
"""foodi"" notification sound is so annoying. My humble request to remove the sound.",True
I don’t know what's the problem in this app. I can't enter the app & can't order food. I have no network problem but the app always has problem. please work on it,True
"can't open the app only stuck in the location interface, already have a order running but can't figure out what is happening, can't see any updates of my order 🙄",True
"worst food delivery app, always problem with location,",True
super fast,True
nice,True
First time discount is only 10%..!. food panda is best.,True
No voucher for new users. nothing fancy to be encourage and make the first order,True
LoL this stupid app cannot even calculate food price why did u even make this so clumsy🤣,True
"Took me only 1 order to uninstall this app, must be some kinda record! Just stick to the big boys, folks. This app is just a cheap rip-off of FoodPanda anyway, only with a lot more lagging. They've copied everything from FP, down to the minute UI details. But they couldn't copy the class that is customer service.",True

Foodi is the only Food delivery app I've used recently. the experience was Amazing!,True

Disgusting experience. Availed 100tk off on EBL Card on Kacchi Dine full plate. But they delivered half plate with 2 piece mutton on a full plate box. Utterly disappointed.,True
"You order food from this platform, and items are missing when you get them. Universal Truth.",True

Best,True
"Never order from this app and if you order don't take the discount. They will give you Smell and spoilage food. Then if you eat those things, your body will get sick. So don't downlaod this app.",True
"Totally disappointed for there delivery service. if you have 2-3 hours time for receve the parcel, then its better option for you. only one impressive things is they can cover long area..",True
Their service is very bad and their policy is not good. Everyone should read the policy. They cannot solve any problem.,True
A very affordable and amazing food delivery app!,True
annoying notification sound.,True
totally worthless help center,True
Service is good,True
There delivery system is too slow. worst experience.,True
no option for deleting my account,True
Bad 😢 dissatisfied,True
Service is not available all over Dhaka. Even rider charge more than the selected charge 😑😑,True
"the payment option is currently not working. I tried logging on and order from a restaurant, but there was no cash on delivery option.",True
Although pretty good and cheap but there are lots of bugs in the app. like restaurants sometimes just disappear? not one but all of them. it just pisses me off. would give 4 stars if that problem was solved,True
good,True
The worst experience each time I order food through this platform. Every time they take more than an hour. Never order through them if you really need your food in time. 0% recommended .,True
"I order in Foodi only when Pathao Food or FoodPanda is not taking orders or the desired restaurant is unavailable to my priority apps. But whenever I place an order I always face issues with their app. Once I faced an issue when I selected an item but because of this buggy app, it did not place during checkout. Another time I selected an item of two pieces but this bloody buggy app selected the item three times. And it takes forever to deliver my food.",True
They should expand their delivery area otherwise everything is good,True
"Just horrible, just do yourself a favor and order from food panda, their customer service is so much better.",True
too slow,True
best thing is it's coverage is large. I try to always tip the rider so that they can keep up their services like it. no hidden charge or complexity like other platform.,True
this app is very good price,True
good customer service. delivery price bit high compared to customer,True
good 👍🏻😊,True
What an app!! Excellent work from the local team,True
This app has many problems. There is no profile option. I can't change phone number and have to open new account. This app should be developed,True

the worst app I have seen ever they don't even pay back if something is missing in the order don't use this app most recommender,True
high recommend,True
One of the best app to order food.,True
the app is good but their service is terrible. sometimes they even take more than 2 hours to deliver the food. so what's the point of taking the order if you are not able to deliver the food on time!!,True
the app has a lot of bug... the order details vanish suddenly and then after few minutes the order appears again..... this is really unfortunate... can I had to pay two times for the order as I order second time when the first order vanishes....,True

we ordered a birthday cake from foodie for my friend. They literally damaged it upon delivery and then made us wait for 2 hours... and during this time all they did was saying sorry... also they made the delivery man call us constantly and the delivery man told us that he will bkash us 200 taka as if we were begging for money....where we already have paid the total 1019 taka in advance. And the irony is it took them 2 freaking hours to decide that they will give us redelivery...,True

account create issue,True
Worse as hell!,True
"holy....it is bad. ordered a few times. most of the time food came late. ordered today, delivery man came 1.30hrs late and with order of someone else. now he went back to get my order again. foodis unprofessional management makes these delivery man suffer more. foodi management is bad. uninstalling today. get fixed.",True
"3rd class app totally. order was placed at 1 pm, supposed to be delivered at 1.30, 2.30 pm still rider didnt pick up the order. tried to contact with the customer service multiple times, no solution. they dont have any proper maintenance. worst service. never ever going to ordee from this app again.",True
"trashy app, there was voucher on card payment. but payment wasn't processing. after I informed the chat support they just said there's no problem from their side. not even sorry for wasting my time. Then said I should just reinstall app, I did and still not working. My card is fully functional and made transactions moments after it on foodpanda. At least when I complain on foodpanda they compensate with vouchers. previously also complained about order issue, they don't compensate",True
"Stuck at the resturants page, cant order anything. this is a Major bug and makes the app unsuable and useless.",True
Bad app. Can't navigate restaurant easily.,True

ok,True

The worst app its freeze the screen .,True
"Whenever I enter into any restaurant, the screen is stuck. no scroll or sliding happens.",True
Worst app. Can't even add an item to the cart. This should be the bare minimum working feature. Ironically the primary feature is non-functional. Absolute disappointment!,True
the worst app I have ever used. didnt deliver my food and no refund either. deleting this app was the best decision I ever made.,True
Worst experience and its 2 times. bye bye to Foodi forever,True
excellent service,True
Super fast delivery,True
"For some days I am not able to place order in this app. Profile screen works, even I can enter the menu of a restaurant but after that either the app freezes or the menu doesn't work at all.",True
There was a bad smell in one of the orders. The food had already started to rot. I complained right away and even sent pictures when they asked. Today they called me and said they spoke with the restaurant...according to the restaurant the food was fine. That’s why they can’t give me a refund. Instead they said they’ll give me a “sorry voucher” for the bad experience. why would any restaurant ever admit that their food was spoiled? What kind of customer service is this?,True
good,True
very good service good experience 😀,True
the app is not even working on my phone. I can't see the food menu. I cannot even order it too. please fix it.,True
"They turned off the review section, so what's the use of reviewing? They told me reviews are big so they couldn't fit in the app. What a joke! Tracking order doesn't work at all. The help center is useless and takes 15-20 mins to reply. After 2-3 hours they'll call n say that if u still have food we'll replace it. If any item isn't available, there's no revised bill. Subscription shows pickup order option and discounts but there's hardly any pickup restaurant option or discounts.",True
Poor service😐,True
can't install,True
This app was good as it was cheaper then Foodpanda but recently when I enter any restaurant's page to order the I can't scroll down as if the page froze I have install and uninstall to check if it works. But all the time same result. it work when I am scrolling the restaurant options but when I enter a specific restaurant page the page just get frozen.,True
"Worst user interface and user experience, too slow app. also the delivery service is bad.",True
Makes mistake in total bill count. Everytime it's add extra charges on total bill without any valid point mention in the description. Please correct this type of mistakes.,True
"worst app ever! Offers discount on food but delievers food that match the discounted price, not the food u ordered! such a fraud",True
not very good. because there is no discount and vouchers are available in this app. foodpanda is very good and save our money,True
Foodi is dead. Average waiting time is 50 minutes to 1 hour. Can you imagine? It's like you have to guess when you will be hungry and then order food in 2 days advance. Then MAYBE you will get your food on time.,True
very bad,True
There customer service is not so good. I got my order wrong. I asked solutions. It took them literally 2 hrs to do the right thing. First you wait for your order for too long & then wait another 2 hour for their mistake. I used this app for several time but each time it disappoints me. Nice keep up this bad service!!,True
Very disappointing! Delivery takes way too long. Totally dissatisfied with the service,True
The app does not work in Android 15.,True
worst service. I tried more then 20 time but I didn’t received any OTP for my number verification.,True

I ordered food they take 1 hour it's not a big deal but they gave me the wrong order. Then I complained about it They took more hours to solve it. Their rider told me to compromise.,True
"I like the app because of its location accuracy. which food panda didn't do it . On food panda , I have to set location blah, blah. On Foodi, just turn on the location .Don't need to set. Must highly recommend to download this app",True
disgusting service,True
"App is not working. Can't order. Why not take a good developer or use AI? I hungry I want to bacon houses from burger express. Also paying pro is not a good idea, cuz as soon as you use an offer the benefits of paying pro fades away.",True
"This is the worst food delivery app I have used in my life. It once delivered my food at 12:30 in the night after I had placed the order at 9:45ish. And every complaint, I have regarding any issues , it seems they have zero solutions towards it and zero zeal to improve them further. Perhaps the worst food delivery app I have used in the country so far. I generally don't write reviews but they have forced me to. And If there was a way to give a 0 star, they would probably deserve that.",True
The app is good. But the food rescue is a scam. I responded in less than 10 seconds but it shows the offer is not available. They don't give any offers or promo,True
Very bad experience. i Can't find any thing special.,True
Suddenly puts a location previously WITHIN their delivery zone to 'OUT of delivery' zone. Really disappointing. N.B. its not even any remote location.,True

4 days ago I ordered some food like 2 pieces of chicken rice platter and some cheese nuggets from rice and spice total cost around 413 tk so first of all it took them 1 hr and 30 mins to give me my food 2nd the size was like 20 tk peice size but I payed 150 for that nugget didn't have a single cheese I payed 120 for that when I complained they said they would look into that matter and fix it I showed them pics also they said they would call medidn't fix anything and didn't givemeanything,True
"I've been using both foodpanda and foodi for a while now, one thing is for sure which is obviously noticeable that the price is lower in foodi than foodpanda. But I'd like to give some suggestions, one thing is there are so many restaurants in which photos of the food are not available so maybe sometimes some people do not really understand what they're buying (just in case), so maybe add some and another suggestion might be that, foodpanda offers grocery buying, you can also do that.",True
first delivery,True
there are no option to review after 1 hours? why its must 24 hours need to option opened.,True
"everything is fine. everything works. but logging in is always such a problem. like i press in ""forgot password"" and then I have to wait for the code and I don't even know where it comes from. that's a small problem, but that's causing so much. i think it's a good idea to include where the code is coming from, it's efficient. please take this as a sign to improve and not just let this problem be. thank you. either way, this app has helped me a lot. getting food deliveries were never this easy.",True
new update is really good. i love ordring through foodi.,True

They agree to it and now FOODI are not letting me pay on cash on delivery . so yea that sums it up . its their fault and I lose the access to pay cash on delivery 😑",True
one time i ordered food and the delivery guy said he was on my address but he wasn't I was waiting for 20 mins straight then he cancelled tye order at last now I can't pay on cod do smth abt it,True
The worst app I used ever. Didn't get my food on time. They were late almost 2 hours. I ordered for the first time And get so disappointed. I'll never recommend anyone to use this app ever. And also the management isn't good enough.Also when I want to open the account they gave instructions to use capital letter small letter and so on. I followed all the instructions though the account isn't opened. After so many attempts then I can open my account.,True

Not good. Brac bank credit card doesn't work. I thought there's something wrong with my card. But immediately worked on another platform. You guys need to get your house in order.,True
There service is getting worsen everyday after ordering they will take literary 1-2 hours then they will cancel it saying the food is unavailable,True
Terrible experience. Never pay in advance here. Horrible app with trash service.,True
Service is very poor. Had to wait more than an hour to get served . Maybe they have appointed fewer people than needed. The vouchers don't work. Not up to the mark.,True

"You should monitor how long it takes to make the recipe and deliver it to the consumers. on this app, i at least have to wait 2 and a half hour for my food to arrive. is that what a customer want? please don't use this app if you hope to receive your order within an hour or so. they don't care about the customers.",True
"i have been using it for 6 7 months now and its my honest review,the app was fine but it deducted my money 3 4 times when i did online payments and got no food and didn't even get a refund..i called them but there was no help from their side.. very very poor customer service secondly i ordered 3 days back and 1 item was missing,they didn't even take responsibility. deleting this app 0 recommendations",True
"Extremely disappointing. Stay away. They deliver food long after the promised time, & it’s always cold, tasteless, and poorly packed. The customer service is beyond useless—they can’t communicate properly and offer no solution at all. The app and website are a joke—slow, buggy, and missing essential features. Ordering through Foodi feels like a gamble every time. Honestly, Foodpanda is a thousand times better—this company can’t even come close. Foodi is a poorly run, unprofessional, & unreliable",True

Delay delivery of food,True
"I've been using both Foodpanda and Foodi for a while now, and one thing that really stands out is the price difference between the two—even when ordering the exact same dish from the same restaurant. While both apps offer a decent delivery experience and user interface, Foodi clearly gives better value for money. Foodpanda consistently charges more.",True

The food by then has lost its taste and seeps through the paper container. In one ocassion, after almost 2 hours the rider said that this wasn't his order initially but was just posted to him few minutes ago. Horrible strategy, dealing with food very carelessly",True
"Frustrating & Broken App! This app is a complete mess. Basic features like updating my address or applying vouchers simply don’t work. The app crashes constantly, and even when it does function, the experience is anything but seamless. What’s worse is the lack of reliability; if I can’t even trust the app to process simple changes, how can I trust it with my orders? Save yourself from the headache and look elsewhere until they fix this broken system.",True

always used to order through foodie because of their affordable pricing and delivery charge.But sadly now it has the highest delivery charge comparative to all food delivery apps and they include vat too which stopped me to use foodie anymore.They should solve this problem and make this app affordable like before,True
worst help center ever. should get banned for such behaviour,True
"Even as I am writing this review, I am still waiting for my order I placed 2 hours ago. Horrible service. I know they show a bit more discount than the other food apps but trust me, waiting 2 hours is not worth it for any discount. Update: They never delivered the food. cancelled it after 2 hours of waiting. They took no responsibility about it for days when I contacted them. They think that customers are beggars and coupon of 100 taka (not all restaurants) would make everything straight.",True

Terrible delivery time. They say 20-30 minutes for an hour and deliver usually within 50-60 minutes. I would much rather know how long it will actually take and wait for that amount than to think I will get my food in 20 minutes and then check the app to see how much longer is left and find out that it will take 25 more minutes,True
Always impose unnecessary Packaging Cost for every product,True

If this happened with Foodpanda, they would have refunded me instantly. -10 Star for Foodi.",True
Worst customer service and extremely laggy app. I misclicked place order while I was trying to make the app work as it was very laggy. Then I contacted their customer support right away as there is supposed to be an interval before the restaurant starts making the food during which the order can be cancelled (Keep in mind I called within seconds of misclicking) Still they did not cancel my order and I was forced to receive something that I did not even want to order.,True

You're just serving in some main areas! I mean why do we need food delivery apps? Of course to get the food at our doorstep. You just deliver the food to the places that are next to the restaurant/commercial area. I mean if I'm living next to a restaurant then why do I even need this application? I can get by simply walking to that restaurant. We use food delivering apps as we live 2-3km away from the main commercial street. Try to cover whole Chittagong city.,True
All service are good.but app is too slow,True
"you forgot a very important feature: the option to tell our preferences to the restaurant for every single item, like how do i tell them ""no cheese"" for the first burger, no mayo for the second, and no lettuce for the third? what if i hate sliced cheeses and my friends hate lettuces? foodpanda has this option",True
"Let me save you a hassle. They mostly deliver rotten food and have had several issues with stale food in the past 3 months. Their customer service is terrible. They dont easily exchange stale food and don't refund at all, not even via voucher, and you won't be even able to log a complaint via this app since their support page doesn't load very often.",True
"Late service, and most importantly the feedback of service is not so good. Not recommended",True
Now I know why this app has such a low rating. Gave an order for a restaurant thats 5 mins of walking distance from my home. Its been almost 2 hours and Im still waiting for my order to arrive while I remain hungry. The rider for my order changed midway. And no response to my texts and calls from the riders. Overall a horrible experience,True
"They delivered my food with missing items, and their help center didn’t respond even after I contacted them multiple times. They didn’t even bother to offer a refund. Very unprofessional and unethical customer service!",True

1st Time Using the app.The Service was good💗,True
"Comparatively better in pricing,but need to work on estimated delivery time.",True
"I hardly got my foods in proper time in foodi. Most of the time the delivery is 2/3 times delayer than the estimated delivery time mentioned. Even if I order anything from a very nearer restaurant, it takes too much time. Disappointing!",True
worst,True
good,True
"I have been trying to access the app for the past two days but no page is coming up, it just shows loading. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, same problem, no improvement.",True
"It is very important to add a picture of the food with each food item in the Foodi app. If there is no picture of the food with the name of the food, it is difficult to order. Also, the map and order tracking quality should be improved. Restaurants should be given strict instructions to provide good quality food.",True
"I regret installing Foodi! I uninstalled Foodpanda to support a local app, but this was a huge mistake. Every order takes 2-3 hours, no matter the restaurant. No proper tracking, useless customer service, and no accountability. If I could, I’d rate -10! Foodpanda is way better. Stay away from Foodi!",True
"Far better than foodpanda. Can pre-order, sometimes more discount than foodpanda, customer service is nice they don't give wrong stuff when they don't have it. I personally have no complains except if they can allow us to select voucher instead of typing to allow us to be lazy",True
It's super slow man. Ask your developer team to optimize it.,True
Add a system where we can send our live location to rider in message of foodi app,True
THIS APP IS A SCAM! THEY STOLE MY MONEY. I placed an order with their current location feature which located me to a whole different area. Later on customer service told me they were not able to deliver my food and will not be giving me a refund as I prepaid. After giving them multiple explanations on why it is their fault for not coding their app right they still refused to refund me for my order WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED! I don't even want to put a 1 star on this.,True
Minor bugs in the app! Needs more tweaking. For example fix the refund process and other small things like that.... Overall with the delivery service satisfied!,True
Needs to fix its bugs and location problem,True
3rd class customer service. This will not survive in the long run.,True
"Worst platform to do order! They took almost 1 hour to prepare a food. Even this incident happen not one or two times, every signle order they showed 25 mintues but it take almost 1.5 hour to complete the whole process.",True

Worst experience with their app. In the app showing restaurants have items. When you order something you have to wait 30 minutes to hear from the delivery man that the item is not available in the restaurant. What a harassment and time killing moment! Their CS is responsive but didn't take any initiative.,True
Cart is loading and loading bal,True

It takes them more than 30minutes to inform if a product is available or not.😑 Testing my patience in higher level for this wait limit . Estimated arrival 31 min. 1hr has passed and still no sign of arrival. Its my 3rd time facing this. Never ordering again . Had high hopes,True
"Though the user experience is now slightly better than before, some bugs are still lurking here and there. Besides, numerous essential features are missing e.g. a customer cannot update/cancel his/her order and location after placing the order (there should be a small window of 2-4 minutes). So, both the business team and the dev team should incorporate ideas and features that primarily focus on improving the customer's user experience.",True

Bad delivery service. Delivery man called me after 30 minutes and the first thing he told me that if i want to cancel the order or not. I told him i want the order. Then he came with the food after 1:30 hour. Foodpanda delivers within 25-30 min from the same restaurant.,True

For the first time i ordered.. and they took the full money for 3 items but gave me 2 items....and when chatted to with the customer service they were slow and unwilling.. but the delivery guy was good...

Third class app pure waste,True
Where is discount,True
"When I first found my favorite restaurant on Foodie and ordered it, it was delivered very quickly. After that, I put that restaurant in my favorite list, but after a long time, when I went to look for that restaurant, I couldn't find it. So I searched every day, hoping to find it, but I couldn't find it even once. Then I thought about searching with another address. Then when I searched with another address, I found my favorite restaurant, but when I went to my previous address I can't see it.",True

Horrible experience !!! Full of bugs and support option doesn't even work 😑 Foodpanda 10 times better,True

I have experienced many instances where the delivery person simply did not bother to go place an order at the restaurant because he had no money. He did not cancel the order nor update me and after waiting for an hour, this is what he told me. Even today I have faced similar issue. Fix your operations team first before trying to operate.",True

This app refund policy is worst. Also the support team's communication is weak. They accept food order but doesn't deliver in time. Also if a restaurant has no food but they accepts order and even they doesn't call to let you know that the food is over. I called them after 1 hour then they checked and let me know that restaurant is closed then why they accept the order and whole night I had to fight with my hunger. Next day they didn't gave me any refund. worst app,True

"Absolutely terrible experience with the FOODI app. My order was delayed for hours with vague status updates.

The worst app I used ever. Didn't get my food on time. They were late almost 2 hours. I ordered for the first time And get so disappointed. I'll never recommend anyone to use this app ever.

"Just another pathetic food delivery service that forces us to use Foodpanda. Very frustrating service, ordered food and kept waiting for 2 hours and when called, they are telling that no delivery man is available. What a joke! Also the app is a toy. The development team does not know UX. Also I'm pretty sure, backend is developed by some freshers and inexpert developers. Please hire a good software company if you have wishes to do business in this field.",True
Experiencing significant lag with this app. Needs thorough optimization to perform better.,True

Slow working,True
Me and my friends placed order around 9pm and even after an hour there was no update on the food and the food was not even picked up! So we called the rider and he told that he doesn't have enough money for the order to pay the restaurant so he will transfer the order to someone else! And all these happened after an hour and they didn't bothered to call/text. We then called the foodi hotline and they maybe re-routed the order and food was delivered after another 30 mins. So disappointing service,True
Worst selection. I ordered chicken chap they provided quater grill,True
"You guys are no better than Foodpanda or Pathao food like you claim to be. Why is there a 'Minimum order value 100 taka' for every single restaurants? The bachelor's gotta eat guys please understand that. The food prices are going up every single day, the delivery charge is going up 1 taka almost each day, and loads of restaurant unavailable still. Top it off with very laggy and buggy interface and voila! We got a recipe for a perfect disaster that is Foodi.",True
Not good at all..,True
The best app for food delivery as it provides a lot of discounts and good delivery. But restaurants don't follow the given special instructions. FOODI should emphasis them to do this.,True

I was tired of foodpanda scams..Foodi is a relief for me..Thanks for your wonderful service.,True
When i order and the app says it'll be delivered in 45 mins i expect it to get delivered in time. If the time passed i want compensation for wasting my time and let me reorder somewhere else. But they don't have anything like that. One time i ordered on 9:30 pm and it came at 11:45 pm. No compensation or anything whatsoever. Fix this and then I'll consider giving more stars.,True
Best food delivery app now just need to update support system 🙏,True

I didn’t pay much attention to this matter until I saw someone else mentioning the same issue. Since you are advertising everywhere, claiming to provide discounts and be better than Foodpanda, you should focus on improving your system to meet those expectations.",True

Saw a lot of review from a lot of reviewer here, but most of them seems don't know about how to use it actually (illiterate) or their area are not covered by Foodi. That's not Foodi's fault to not covering the area. The user should first know that if Foodi is available on his/her area or not.

Very slow delivery service very disappointing 😕,True
What you advertise and what you provide is absolutely different. You clearly advertised 150 tk off above 350tk order for new user. But when I installed and used the promo it gave me 100 tk off.

Disgusted.... So disappointing,True
Their offers are delicious 😋 but their delivery system is different than foodpanda. One delivery man delivery multiple customer's delivery at the same time.

"worst food service, never order!",True
"Foodi has potential, but there are some key issues. There are too few restaurants available, which limits options. Also, the app's response time is quite slow, making it frustrating to use, especially when you're in a hurry. One big downside is that there's no way to rate or review the food delivery person’s service, which is important for a complete experience. I hope these issues get addressed soon.",True

Great Experience compared to other delivery platforms in competition. And the best discount deals I've ever seen in my life(like 40% almost everytime not everytime). I'm from Malibagh and I could order from any restaurant around me. The food delivery was very fast(10 mins approx.) which normally took 25-30 mins when I ordered through FoodPanda. The delivery guys were also good. Normally I have to go to downstairs from 4th floor to get my food. But they came to my doorstep on their own.,True
It's the worst app ever made in Bangladesh.I have tried 6-7 times for otp but they are not sending otp or else sending it after the time ends,True

Just after a few days of subscribing as a SuperFoodi for 840 BDT, they reduced their delivery radius hugely. Even when I asked them about it, they disagreed & harassed me immensely. Their customer service providers are significantly irresponsible & non-responsive specially for complain management So guys, use any other Food Delivery platform you prefer, but install Foodi on your own risk.",True

"Useful product but App needs better QA. Issue 1. On Android, when I am viewing a restaurant menu, tapping back button (default phone bottom menu), it takes me all the way back to main menu. Whereas clicking on soft back button (the red one on top of app) takes me one page back. Seems like you have only tested for iOS and not for Android. This is very frustrating because I have to again select Food Delivery then scroll all the way to whichever scroll-point/ restaurant I was looking at.",True
