User Friendly Bakery App
Easy To use Good
Very good
This app is not working properly. Full of bugs I guess And most importantly the helpline number you provided on your app is always busy Not a good app for communicating or making orders
Taste is good but the price is beyond middle class's buying capacity 👎
No discount offer
Really good
Very Good Initiative from COOPER'S
Good
In the app there is showing 40% discount will be applied for the 1st order. But there is no discount during checkout! Fraud seller.
The app doesn't work properly at all
